		"history": "The polytechnic is situated within Oko town in Orumba North Local Government of Anambra State. The kernel of what eventually became the polytechnic was the brain child of the Oko Progressive Union (OPU) greatly catalysed by the patronage, resourcefulness and result oriented leadership of its pioneer chairman, a former Executive Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Dr. Alex Ekwueme. At inception in 1979, the institution was approved by the Anambra State Government as a College of Arts and Science designed to prepare candidates for the General Certificate in Education (GCE) examination at both the ordinary and advanced levels. On June 28,1980, the institution was upgraded to College of Arts, Science and Technology, an elevation that made it more attractive to young school leavers who came in droves to seek the higher certificate which the College could then award. The College was formalized as the Anambra State Polytechnic, Oko through Edict No. 12 of 1985, published as a supplement to the Anambra State of Nigeria Gazette No. 24, Volume 10 of June 27, 1984. Finally, in 1993, the State Polytechnic was taken over by the Federal Government and was renamed Federal Polytechnic, Oko. The institution is strategically located and surrounded by several centres of industries, commerce and diverse local crafts such as Awka (well known for blacksmith/iron works), Nnewi (Industry and technological products) and Onitsha and Aba (reputed for Commerce and Industries). The climatic condition of the host community, Ok ranges between 28 and 42 degrees centigrade. It is one of the fastest developing tertiary institutions in Nigeria with high futuristic disposition. It has functional memorandum of understanding with different universities within and outside the country. The Polytechnic has three campuses.The main campus at Oko which occupies a total land area of 89 hectres. Ufuma campus: This occupies a total land area of 52 hectres.Atani campus: This occupies a total area of 40 hectres.The institution at the moment has entered into research collaboration with the following Universities in the spirit of South-South Cooperation: Today, Federal Polytechnic Oko ranks very high amongst the most preferred institutions by candidates for Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Little wonder the Chairman, Senate Committee on Education, late Distinguished Senator Uche Chukwumerije during a one-day official oversight function visit to the institution declared Federal Polytechnic, Oko, “the fastest growing institution in the country.” The administration because of the level of discipline, courage, dedication, diligence and commitment exhibited by members of the Management Team and in a special manner, the Acting Rector’s humble drive and commitment to prudence in financial management reflected in usage of internally generated revenue, capital allocation, interventionist grants and out sourcing from philanthropists has been able to accomplish all the projects and programmes chronicled in this document which is making us and the institution very proud.",
